# solovox
This is a set of M3u8 manifest files that can be used with a Solovox IPTV box.
The solovox V9S box is cheap but fairly limited in terms of reading standard m3u formatting.
Creating a tvlist.txt file linking to these raw github files should minimize the need for changing m3u8 files on a frequent basis.

My main interests are Spanish and English TV / Radio although I will post any other interesting stuff I find.

This is also to help me learn and understand how GIT works.
